Module 2 Homework

### Homework

For this week’s assignment I used the prompts to guide how I should write lines of code to create a working, interactive menu ordering system. The prompts overall were about deconstructing, reconstructing dictionaries and using loops to not only read and process the data, but also compound inputs to give the user a final, total cost in a receipt.

### Struggles

While conceptually this made sense to me, my inexperience with actually writing the code was apparent. I used office hours, tutoring and chatGPT to help me build my confidence with the language of the code. In full transparency, the tutor had me go through each line of code and explain what each component was and what it was doing, what it correlated to, and why it was needed. This gave me the context I was needing, to better think like a developer.

### Conclusion

While I did run into some hiccups with syntax nuances, on the whole I’m getting a better appreciation for the quirkiness of python. I’m still struggling with the when/where to break loops, but the logic of localized loops definitely resonates. Overall, it was a challenging first assignment.
